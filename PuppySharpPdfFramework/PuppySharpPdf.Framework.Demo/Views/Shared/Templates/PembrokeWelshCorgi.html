        <p>
            According to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America, it is believed that the Pembroke’s ancestry dates back to at least the 10th century. It is unknown, however, whether they are descended from the Swedish Vallhunds that were possibly brought to Pembrokeshire by the Vikings, or from the ancestors of the present-day Schipperkes and Pomeranians brought to Wales by Flemish weavers.

        <h5 class="text-black-50">3. They make world-class herding dogs.</h5>
        <p>
            Don’t let their size fool you, these dogs have been herding for decades! From the beginning, the Welsh used Pembroke Welsh Corgis as herding dogs, family companions, and guardians of the farm. Even today, these dogs are still expert herders. Many Pembrokes even compete in AKC Herding competitions.

        <h5 class="text-black-50">4. They are very different from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.</h5>
        <p>
            In 1934, the AKC recognized the Pembroke and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi as two distinct breeds. What is different about these two dogs? First, the Cardigan traces its origins to Cardiganshire, and the Pembroke to Pembrokeshire. The dogs also have easily identifiable physical differences. The Cardigan has a longer tail, while the Pembroke’s is docked close to the body. The Pembroke has a shorter body, and the ears are pointed, while the Cardigan’s are more rounded at the tips.

        <p>
            The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is known as one of the most agreeable of small house dogs and is a loyal, loving pet for families. They also are known for their intelligence and enthusiasm for working. Many Pembrokes compete in dog sports, such as agility, herding, conformation, obedience, and more.

        <p>
            Your dog may tire themself out running around in circles, dashing from room to room, also known as "frantic random acts of play" or more casually, "zoomies".

        <h5 class="text-black-50">7. Corgi means "dwarf dog."</h5>
        <p>
            Or at least it might. The origin of the name "Corgi" is difficult to determine. Some say it combines the Welsh word "cor," which means to watch over or gather, with "gi," a form of the Welsh word for dog. Others have the interpretation that the word "cor" means dwarf, and combine that with "gi," you have dwarf dog. Either way, these certainly describe the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. And of course, the "Pembroke Welsh" part of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi name comes from the dog’s origins.

        <h5 class="text-black-50">8. A Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Rufus was the mascot for Amazon.</h5>
        <p>
            In the early days of Amazon.com, a Pembroke named Rufus belonged to the editor-in-chief and principal engineer and came with them to work every day. Known for walking the halls, attending meetings, and snoozing, Rufus became the unofficial Amazon mascot. Rufus is also the dog Amazon employees have to thank for their dog-friendly culture.
