            <p>
                According to the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America, it is believed that the Pembroke’s ancestry dates back to at least the 10th century. It is unknown, however, whether they are descended from the Swedish Vallhunds that were possibly brought to Pembrokeshire by the Vikings, or from the ancestors of the present-day Schipperkes and Pomeranians brought to Wales by Flemish weavers.

            <p>
                Don’t let their size fool you, these dogs have been herding for decades! From the beginning, the Welsh used Pembroke Welsh Corgis as herding dogs, family companions, and guardians of the farm. Even today, these dogs are still expert herders. Many Pembrokes even compete in AKC Herding competitions.

            <p>
                In 1934, the AKC recognized the Pembroke and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi as two distinct breeds. What is different about these two dogs? First, the Cardigan traces its origins to Cardiganshire, and the Pembroke to Pembrokeshire. The dogs also have easily identifiable physical differences. The Cardigan has a longer tail, while the Pembroke’s is docked close to the body. The Pembroke has a shorter body, and the ears are pointed, while the Cardigan’s are more rounded at the tips.

            <p>
                The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is known as one of the most agreeable of small house dogs and is a loyal, loving pet for families. They also are known for their intelligence and enthusiasm for working. Many Pembrokes compete in dog sports, such as agility, herding, conformation, obedience, and more.

            <p>
                Or at least it might. The origin of the name “Corgi” is difficult to determine. Some say it combines the Welsh word “cor,” which means to watch over or gather, with “gi,” a form of the Welsh word for dog. Others have the interpretation that the word “cor” means dwarf, and combine that with “gi,” you have dwarf dog. Either way, these certainly describe the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. And of course, the “Pembroke Welsh” part of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi name comes from the dog’s origins.

                In the early days of Amazon.com, a Pembroke named Rufus belonged to the editor-in-chief and principal engineer and came with them to work every day. Known for walking the halls, attending meetings, and snoozing, Rufus became the unofficial Amazon mascot. Rufus is also the dog Amazon employees have to thank for their dog-friendly culture.

            <p>
                Often called the “Corgi with a tail,” this breed's tail is an easy way to distinguish the Cardigan from their Pembroke cousins.

            <h5 class="text-black-50">2. They Have Been Known in Their Namesake Land for More Than 3,000 Years</h5>
            <p>
                The Cardigan Welsh Corgi came to Cardiganshire with the Celts from Central Europe in around 1200 B.C. This makes them the older of the two Corgi breeds and also one of the earliest breeds in the British Isles.

            <p>
                Hundreds of years ago, the royal family in Wales owned practically all land, and farmers were allowed to fence off only a few acres surrounding their property. They could however, let their cattle graze on the remaining common land. With the competition for pasture between farmers, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi was trained not to herd, but to nip at the heels of the cattle and drive them far across the land.

            <h5 class="text-black-50">4. Their Name Means “Dwarf Dog”</h5>
            <p>
                The Corgi was named “cor” for dwarf (or perhaps “cur” for working dog) and “gi” for dog. Cardigan Welsh refers to their homeland.

            <p>
                Ancient Welsh law called for severe penalties to anyone who harmed or stole the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, because his talents could help determine his family's economic status.

            <h5 class="text-black-50">6. Their Ears Are Amazing</h5>
            <p>
                Not only are the Cardigan's big ears adorable, but they are also extremely useful. They have incredibly acute hearing that can distinguish between familiar sounds and strange noises, making the Cardigan Welsh Corgi a great watchdog. They also have used their hearing to roll out of the way from an approaching kick from a cow.

            <h5 class="text-black-50">7. They Have Had Three Different Group Designations</h5>
            <p>
                The Cardigan Welsh Corgi, recognized by the AKC in 1935, was originally in the Non-Sporting Group. They were later moved to the Working Group, and then the Herding Group, where they now reside.

            <p>
                The Cardigan Welsh Corgi may be short in statue, but not in energy or ability. They are great companion dogs; they love to be with people. And since they are natural herding dogs, Cardigan Welsh Corgis also excel in dog sports, like agility.
